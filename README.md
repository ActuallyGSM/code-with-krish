Note: As I communicated with the supportive group, I was dealing with permission issues to commit my changes to Git. So, as a workaround, we removed the entire repo, but I still was not able to release my changes as I got the permission issue. Eventually, I found a way to push it to git through the Git Desktop Client. 
If you see any recent commit please be aware of the issue I was dealt with.
